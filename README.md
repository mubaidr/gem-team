## 🤔 Why Gem Team?

### ✨ Why It Works

- ⚡ **10x Faster** — Parallel execution eliminates bottlenecks
- 🏆 **Higher Quality** — Specialized agents + TDD + verification gates = fewer bugs
- 🔒 **Built-in Security** — OWASP scanning on critical tasks
- 👁️ **Full Visibility** — Real-time status, clear approval gates
- 🛡️ **Resilient** — Pre-mortem analysis, failure handling, auto-replanning
- ♻️ **Pattern Reuse** — Codebase pattern discovery prevents reinventing wheels
- 🪞 **Self-Correcting** — All agents self-critique at 0.85 confidence threshold before returning results
- 📋 **Source Verified** — Every factual claim cites its source (PRD, codebase, docs, online); no guesswork — if unclear, agents ask for clarification
- ♿ **Accessibility-First** — WCAG compliance validated at both spec and runtime layers
- 🔬 **Smart Debugging** — Root-cause analysis with stack trace parsing, regression bisection, and confidence-scored fix recommendations
- 🚀 **Safe DevOps** — Idempotent operations, health checks, and mandatory approval gates for production
- 🔗 **Traceable** — Self-documenting IDs link requirements → tasks → tests → evidence
- 📚 **Knowledge-Driven** — Agents consult prioritized sources (PRD → codebase patterns → AGENTS.md → Context7 → docs → online) for informed decisions
- 🛠️ **Skills & Guidelines** — Built-in skill modules (docx, pdf, pptx, xlsx, web-design-guidelines) ensure format-accurate, accessibility-compliant outputs
- 🎯 **Decision-Focused** — Research outputs highlight blockers and decision points for planners
- 📋 **Rich Specification Creation** — PRD creation with user stories, IN/OUT of scope, acceptance criteria, and clarification tracking
- 📐 **Spec-Driven Development** — Specifications define the "what" before the "how", with multi-step refinement rather than one-shot code generation from prompts

### Single-Agent Problems → Gem Team Solutions

| Problem | Solution |
|:--------|:---------|
| Context overload | **Specialized agents** with focused expertise |
| No specialization | **11 expert agents** with clear roles and zero overlap |
| Sequential bottlenecks | **DAG-based parallel execution** (≤4 agents, ≤8 with `fast`) |
| Missing verification | **TDD + mandatory verification gates** per agent |
| Intent misalignment | **Discuss phase** captures intent; **clarification tracking** in PRD |
| No audit trail | Persistent **`plan.yaml` and `PRD.yaml`** tracks every decision & outcome |
| Over-engineering | **Architectural gates** validate simplicity; **gem-critic** challenges assumptions |
| Untested accessibility | **WCAG spec validation** (gem-designer) + **runtime checks** (gem-browser-tester) |
| Blind retries | **Diagnose-then-fix**: gem-debugger finds root cause → confidence gate → gem-implementer applies fix → original agent re-verifies |
| Single-plan risk | Complex tasks get **3 planner variants** → best DAG selected automatically |
| Missed edge cases | **gem-critic** audits for logic gaps, boundary conditions, YAGNI violations |
| Docs drift from code | **Auto-included docs tasks** for new features ensures code-documentation parity |
| Unsafe deployments | **Approval gates** block production/security changes until confirmed |
| Browser fragmentation | **Multi-browser testing** via Chrome MCP, Playwright, and Agent Browser |
| Broken contracts | **Contract verification** post-wave ensures dependent tasks integrate correctly |
| Knowledge gaps | **Prioritized knowledge sources** (PRD, codebase, AGENTS.md, Context7, docs, online) |
| Unverified facts | **Source-cited claims** — every fact cites source; no guesswork — if unclear, agents ask |
| Format inconsistency | **Built-in skills** (docx, pdf, pptx, xlsx) + **web-design-guidelines** for consistent, accessible outputs |

## 🔄 Core Workflow

The Orchestrator follows a 6-phase workflow with automatic phase detection.

### Phase Detection

| Condition | Action |
|:----------|:-------|
| No plan + simple | Research (skip Discuss) |
| No plan + medium\|complex | Discuss Phase |
| Plan + pending tasks | Execution Loop |
| Plan + feedback | Planning |
| All tasks done | Summary |

### 2️⃣ Discuss Phase (medium|complex only)

- **Identifies gray areas** → 2-4 context-aware options per question
- **Asks 3-5 targeted questions** → Architectural decisions → `AGENTS.md`
- **Task clarifications** captured for PRD creation

### 3️⃣ PRD Creation

- **Creates** `docs/PRD.yaml` from Discuss Phase outputs
- **Includes:** user stories, IN SCOPE, OUT OF SCOPE, acceptance criteria
- **Tracks clarifications:** status (open/resolved/deferred) with owner assignment

### 4️⃣ Phase 1: Research

- **Detects complexity** (simple/medium/complex)
- **Delegates to gem-researcher** (≤4 concurrent) per focus area
- **Output:** `docs/plan/{plan_id}/research_findings_{focus}.yaml` (or `docs/research_findings_{timestamp}.yaml` for standalone calls)

### 5️⃣ Phase 2: Planning

- **Complex:** 3 planner variants (a/b/c) → selects best
- **gem-reviewer** validates with architectural checks (simplicity, anti-abstraction, integration-first)
- **gem-critic** challenges assumptions
- **Planning history** tracks iteration passes for continuous improvement
- **Output:** `docs/plan/{plan_id}/plan.yaml` (DAG + waves)

### 6️⃣ Phase 3: Execution

- **Executes in waves** (wave 1 first, wave 2 after)
- **≤4 agents parallel** per wave
- **TDD cycle:** Red → Green → Refactor → Verify
- **Contract-first:** Write contract tests before implementing tasks with dependencies
- **Wave integration:** get_errors → build → lint/typecheck/tests → contract verification
- **On failure:** gem-debugger diagnoses → confidence check (≥0.7) → IF code fix: gem-implementer → original agent re-verifies
- **On needs_revision:** Same diagnose-then-fix chain — never direct re-delegate
- **Auto-invocations:** gem-critic after each wave (complex); gem-designer validates UI tasks post-wave

### 7️⃣ Phase 4: Summary

- **Decision log:** All key decisions with rationale (backward reference to requirements)
- **Production feedback:** How to verify in production, known limitations, rollback procedure
- **Presents** status, next steps
- **User feedback** → routes back to Planning

## 🤖 The Agent Team

| Agent | Role | When to Use |
|:------|:-----|:------------|
| `gem-orchestrator` | 🎯 **ORCHESTRATOR** | Coordinates multi-agent workflows, delegates tasks. Never executes directly. |
| `gem-researcher` | 🔍 **RESEARCHER** | Research, explore, analyze code, find patterns, investigate dependencies. Decision-focused output with blockers highlighted. |
| `gem-planner` | 📋 **PLANNER** | Plan, design approach, break down work, estimate effort. Supports prototype tasks, planning passes, and multiple iterations. Auto-includes documentation tasks for new features. |
| `gem-implementer` | 🔧 **IMPLEMENTER** | Implement, build, create, code, write, fix (TDD). Uses contract-first approach for tasks with dependencies. |
| `gem-browser-tester` | 🧪 **BROWSER TESTER** | Test UI, browser tests, E2E, flow testing, visual regression, accessibility runtime validation. |
| `gem-devops` | 🚀 **DEVOPS** | Deploy, configure infrastructure, CI/CD, containers with health checks and approval gates. |
| `gem-reviewer` | 🛡️ **REVIEWER** | Review, audit, security scan, compliance. Never modifies. Performs architectural checks and contract verification. Validates: compliance with spec/PRD. |
| `gem-documentation-writer` | 📝 **DOCUMENTATION** | Document, write docs, README, API docs, diagrams, walkthroughs. Auto-assigned to new feature tasks. |
| `gem-debugger` | 🔬 **DEBUGGER** | Debug, diagnose, root cause analysis, trace errors. Never fixes - only diagnoses. |
| `gem-critic` | 🎯 **CRITIC** | Critique, challenge assumptions, edge cases, over-engineering. Validates: approach correctness. |
| `gem-code-simplifier` | ✂️ **SIMPLIFIER** | Simplify, refactor, dead code removal, reduce complexity. |
| `gem-designer` | 🎨 **DESIGNER** | Design UI, create themes, layouts. Two modes: create (specs before) and validate (review after). Validates: accessibility spec compliance. |

### Agent File Skeleton

Each `.agent.md` file follows this structure:

```
---                                    # Frontmatter: description, name, triggers
# Role                                 # One-line identity
# Expertise                            # Core competencies
# Knowledge Sources                    # Prioritized reference list
# Workflow                             # Step-by-step execution phases
  ## 1. Initialize                     # Setup and context gathering
  ## 2. Analyze/Execute                # Role-specific work
  ## N. Self-Critique                  # Confidence check (≥0.85)
  ## N+1. Handle Failure               # Retry/escalate logic
  ## N+2. Output                       # JSON deliverable format
# Input Format                         # Expected JSON schema
# Output Format                        # Return JSON schema
# Rules
  ## Execution                         # Tool usage, batching, error handling
  ## Constitutional                    # IF-THEN decision rules
  ## Anti-Patterns                     # Behaviors to avoid
  ## Anti-Rationalization              # Excuse → Rebuttal table
  ## Directives                        # Non-negotiable commands
```

All agents share: Execution rules, Constitutional rules, Anti-Patterns, and Directives sections. Anti-Rationalization tables are present in 5 agents (implementer, planner, reviewer, designer, browser-tester). Role-specific sections (Workflow, Expertise, Knowledge Sources) vary by agent.

## ⚙️ Agent Protocol

### Core Rules

- Output ONLY requested deliverable (code: code ONLY)
- Think-Before-Action via internal `<thought>` block
- Batch independent operations; context-efficient reads (≤200 lines per read, ≤2,000 lines per task)
- Agent-specific `verification` criteria from plan.yaml
- Self-critique: agents reflect on output before returning results
- Knowledge sources: agents consult prioritized references (PRD → codebase → AGENTS.md → Context7 → docs → online)
- Three-Tier Boundaries: **Always Do** (validate, cite sources, verify) → **Ask First** (destructive ops, architecture changes) → **Never Do** (commit secrets, trust untrusted data, skip gates)
- Anti-Rationalization: Every agent has excuse→rebuttal tables to prevent skipping critical steps
- Scope Discipline: "NOTICED BUT NOT TOUCHING" — document out-of-scope improvements without implementing them

### Verification by Agent

| Agent | Verification |
|:------|:-------------|
| Implementer | get_errors → typecheck → unit tests → contract tests (if applicable) |
| Debugger | reproduce → stack trace → root cause → fix recommendations |
| Critic | assumption audit → edge case discovery → over-engineering detection → logic gap analysis |
| Browser Tester | validation matrix → console → network → accessibility |
| Reviewer (task) | OWASP scan → code quality → logic → task_completion_check → coverage_status |
| Reviewer (plan) | coverage → atomicity → deps → PRD alignment → architectural_checks |
| Reviewer (wave) | get_errors → build → lint → typecheck → tests → contract_checks |
| DevOps | deployment → health checks → idempotency |
| Doc Writer | completeness → code parity → formatting |
| Simplifier | tests pass → behavior preserved → get_errors |
| Designer | accessibility → visual hierarchy → responsive → design system compliance |
| Researcher | decision_blockers → research_blockers → coverage → confidence |
